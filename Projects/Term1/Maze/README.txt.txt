How long did it take to complete the project?
OMG, Took me about 15 days to complete the project.

One thing you liked about the project.
A lot of new things, and some solutions that I applied to the project I had to research a lot to find the solution

One thing that was particularly challenging about the project.
The click event and configure the camera, those things were a little bit complex.
 
Another challenge that I had is in how to display the number of coins collected. I created a UI with canvas to display the value,
but when I played on the phone, it does not work. After research I found that the way to use the UI in VR is different, so I had to
change my design and I decided to put the value at the end of the game. I think this is not the best way but it works :)
