How long it took to complete the project.
 This project took me about 2 hours for 10 days to complete it. 
 I submitted my project a little bit late because I was so busy before in my work, and then I had problems with lighting. 

One thing you liked about the project.
 This is my first experience creating a project and add animations, the project before everything was done, 
 just need to adjust some setting, but this one is like doing everything (Except to create the props), I love it.

One thing that was particularly challenging about the project.
 The lighting, I expend like 3 days understanding how to apply the baking.
 
 Another challenge was the animation using the click, in the instructions said that I need to use a provided Trigger Animation, 
 but I did the animation a little bit different. I created my own script using some logic and it works. 
 I want to know if is necessary to use the script that you provided or is acceptable to use my own script. 

Thank
